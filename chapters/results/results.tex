\section{Notes to this chapter}
Key takeaways from \cite{Piairo2018}:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Databases, although different from applications, can and should be included in the same development process as applications. We call this database shift left.
	\item When all database changes are described with scripts, source control can be applied and the database development process can include continuous integration and continuous delivery activities, namely taking part in the deployment pipeline.
	\item Automation is the special ingredient that powers up the deployment pipeline making it repeatable, reliable and fast, reducing fear for database changes.
	\item Migrations-based and state-based are two different approaches to describing a database change. Independently of the choice, small batches are always a good choice.
	\item The deployment pipeline is a technical and cultural tool where DevOps values and practices should be reflected according to the needs of each organization.    
\end{itemize}
